## Error Code

```python

Could not identify NUMA node of platform GPU ID 0, defaulting to 0.
Your kernel may not have been built with NUMA support.

> MacOS with AMD GPU here. I am using tensorflow for metal as soon as it was launched, with GPU acceleration. Sometimes I get the same message (Could not identify NUMA node of platform GPU ID 0, defaulting to 0. Your kernel may not have been built with NUMA support.). But, it still uses the GPU. You can check that by opening Activity Monitor, then pressing Cmd + 3 and Cmd + 4, which shows you GPU and CPU usage.
One potential problem for you, assuming it still is not benefitting from acceleration, could be that you are using Python 3.9. If I recall correctly, tensorflow for metal requires Python 3.8. That is what I am using, without any problems.
Hope the above can help you & others!

This arises with the latest tensorflow-metal package ver. 0.2.0.
Just install the last version 0.1.2. of metal and the GPU will be utlized. You will still get the warning though but the training will run utlizing the GPU.

I've tried creating a clean python 3.8 and 3.9 installation following instructions here and elsewhere. Tried downgrading my tensor flow-metal package. Just about every possible combination in clean environments and new installations.
Bottom line is that while the GPU "works", it runs about 5x slower than running on pure CPU. Aka if I uninstall tensorflow-metal package the same training that took say 11 sec with the package installed takes only about 2.5 sec without the metal package. You can also replicate same results with forcing tensorflow to run on CPU with the metal package installed.
Looking at Activity Monitor during run suggests that the M1 Max GPU is in fact loaded with the package installed. It just performs horribly poorly, in fact so badly as to be unusable. My working assumption is that this is not the intended performance, but a bug.
What's concerning is that no maintainer in any of the forums, whether it be tensorflow/keras, or whether it be Apple forums, has really acknowledged that this is a bug. Perhaps there's confusion between the different manifestation of the bug in Intel vs. older M1 vs. newer M1 Pro/Max, as well as the different operating systems involved.
So let me be unambiguously clear: none of the stuff listed above here, or in other threads, involving reinstallation, downgrading packages, etc. makes this work on my M1 Max properly.
